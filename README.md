# Pursuit Penguin Game - School project

Game was developed as a school project using Apache Cordova framework.
It uses Javascript and Canvas to draw the game graphics. There is software a joystick to control your penguin in a maze. 
The main point of the game is to get a fish at the end of the maze first. 
Each several seconds maze turns in some direction but controls does not change in order to make game more difficult and challenging.
There is also another penguin in the maze trying to get the fish first.
